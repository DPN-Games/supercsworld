- All debug keys (such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 0 and F5, F6, F7, F8) are now disabled by default and can be re-enabled with "takesecretkeychain" cheat command
- Fixed path-opener wired vision bug on the world map
- Enabled ability to spawn effects on the world map (one effect is spawning a smoke when level or path enabling)

- Implemented full support for custom config files for all elements: block-*.ini, background-*.ini, tile-*.ini, scene-*.ini, path-*.ini, level-*.ini
- Fully implemented support of split configurations for level backgrounds, blocks, BGOs, NPCs, terrain tiles, sceneries, paths and level tiles
- Resolved a visibility management of the layers and transforming between blocks and NPCs

0.2.5.1

- Added more physical environment zones types, include air chambers for underwater sections
- Added separated support of portal and instant warps: instant warp will do same as in SMBX, portal warp will teleport character with keeping of kinetic energy
- Added support of enter event for warps
- Added support of two-way directed warps
- Added support of cannon exit warps
- Better and stable inter-processing with editor based on stdin/stdout!1

- Layer motion engine has been implemented!
- Bit better slopes support
- Player Lua API has been implemented! It provides a programming of playable character events
- Improved onHarm/onKill events on NPC-AI
- Added new NPC-AI events, functions and variables
- Added a support of collision toggling from lua

- Fixed TTF fonts renderer

0.2.5
- Fixed crash on NPC placement with inter-processing
- Sprite in real-time placing mode will be aligned to center of mouse rather left-top corner
- Background color of screen padding no is always black
- Fixed a detection of libraries paths (such as "platforms") while dynamically built PGE Apps are locating in the folder with non-ASCII path
- Player now can attack multiple NPC's at one stomp
- Player now can safely walk from ridable NPC's without jumps
- Removed workaround disables hurting of player while it flying up because player finally can safely stomp healthy NPC's
- Added experimental translator to have able to retranslated engine too
- Optimized memory usage and increased performance
- Now PGE Engine uses FreeImage library to load graphics
- Finally resolved a troubles with a lazily-made graphics, all masked-gif based graphics are merging via bit-blit algorithm

0.2.4
- Working paths system on world map! Now there are closed at episode start, but opens on level passes.
- Fixed bug with auto-spawning of "game over" question on non-zero exit codes
- Fixed missed font-ID grabbing for live counter on the world map
- Small reorganization of cheat codes:
  - illparkwhereiwant instead of "i" key
  - redigitiscool to spawn dummy message box
  - iwishexitas X to exit from a level with specific exit code
- Contact Detector for NPC-AI (detects elements which are contacted to self NPC and returns pointer to them)
- Added ability to spawn other NPC's from NPC-AI scripts
- Working projectile generators!
- Fixed bug with down directed NPC spawn from blocks
- Experimental in-game render of placing elements
- All non-protected NPC's will burn in lava

0.2.3.1
- Small update of File Library
- Support for "health" tag inside npc-*.txt custom configs

- Text Input dialog box has been completely implemented
- Cheating features are been moved into cheat environment and can be used only after typing of special commands by "~" key clicking
- Playable character can be harmed by dangerous surfaces and will die in lava
- Experimental support of slopes
- Player can talk with NPC's
- better work of collisions, but some things are still experimental
- better V-Sync control

0.2.2.4-alpha (First entry of engine change-log)
- Experimental engine part which provides ability play SMBX-compatible levels and episodes
with their configuration packages. Provides partial implementation of SMBX64 standard which wasn't finished yet. Partial implementation of NPC-AI with ability to code NPC's in LUA.
- Physics are completely replaced with own coded physical engine
- Working NPC-AI system with support NPC's coded in the Lua
- Exits works!
- Kill effects [are not works perfect, need a lot of work, but there are works fine]
- Added generators!
- Player can climb on NPC-based climbable walls, not only on the BGO-based!
- Fixed a lot of bugs
- NPC's finally can be spawned from blocks where there are was included!
- Added support of the layers and basic events! [layers: show, hide, toggle;
message box; play SFX; trigger another event; auto-scroll speed, changing of limit
borders per section, toggling section background, toggling section music,
other event actions are not implemented yet].
Working event triggers: block destroy, hit, empty-layer; NPC died, activated, empty layer
[talk is not implemented yet!]
- Fixed random crash caused by lua activation event when camera caught a corpse of NPC
- Fixed slow performance caused by bad time delay function
- Player finally can ride on NPC's heads [anyway, is not finished yet]
- Basic Detectors API for NPC-AI which giving able to catch objects came to specific area
- Fixed bug with super-fast game loop
- Stomp-able NPC's are can be stomped!
- Work with a speed-summing part of physical engine gives ability to stay and ride on the moving objects
- Fixed imperfection with auto-closing of message box while "run" or "jump" key are holding
- Episode/Level lists are no more freezing engine!
- Working auto scrolling of sections has been implemented! (Unlike SMBX, auto-scroll internally
is an option of specific section which will works anyway, even you entered into this section from a side,
you will get auto-scrolling in this section)

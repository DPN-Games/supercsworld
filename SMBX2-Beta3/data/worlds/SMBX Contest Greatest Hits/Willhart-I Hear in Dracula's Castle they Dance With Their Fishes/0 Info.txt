I hear in Dracula's Castle they dance with their fishes.
This level was made by Willhart for the talkhaus MaGL X contest.
Dancing is fun.

Graphics:
Glass pipe things are rezised from Commander Keen 4.
All the candles and the save orb are from Castlevania spritesheets made by Smithygon.
Curtains are from a game Akuji the Demon.
Most of the enemies are from ASMBXT.
Bottle of blood is from a tileset made by Arachne.
The coins, the Dracula Family, the glass windows, and the sunken carrier were drawn by me.
Disco tiles and the chains were used in Talkhaus abode in ASMBXT.
I also used colored, extended versions of the ghosthouse and sMB3 underwater tilesets. 
Dark underwater tileset from supermarioman's v2.0 GFX Pack was also used.


Music:
Music is from Donald Duck: Goin' Quackers and Rayman 2.

Idea for the spring platforms is from a level "Magma Musical" by WiiRool.

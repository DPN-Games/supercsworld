This level is as you may see named Acropolis Ascension. It handles around Athena's Mountain the
Acropolis. This level is inspired from it and seriously, I'm quite proud on this. I think this is even
my best level I ever made. Unusual to all my other levels you can see how I work with Bosses. I can't 
tell an expression for it, I feel like I overdid it but this feeling comes always at a Boss with much
effort. I actually want to know how I did. Another thing that's unusual to all other levels of me this
level is definitely harder than all levels you know from me, I hope this is a good variation for you.
Probably you never heart the Music in this level, so I'll take the right to tell you where they are from.
But I think I did rather unique with them. Well, here they are:

-First Part, Temple Outside - Pokémon Mystery Dungeon 2 Explorers of Time/Dakness/Sky - Hidden Highland
-Second Part, Temple Inside - Inazuma Eleven 2 Blizzard/Fire Storm - Alius Head-Quarter
-Final Part, Section before Boss - Inazuma Eleven - Holy Ground
-Boss Theme - Inazuma Eleven 2 Blizzard/Fire Storm - Genesis (Endboss)

Well now to Credits. This time to make this level a lot more particular than it is there's almost
every single Graphic from me. Here's the Credit List:

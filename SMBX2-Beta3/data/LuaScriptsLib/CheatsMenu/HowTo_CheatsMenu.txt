To make it work, you need to place this line in your lunaworld file.
 

_CheatsMenu = loadAPI("CheatsMenu");


and place CheatsMenu.lua and CheatsMenu folder in the LuaScriptsLib folder !!

For Load the menu press "n" on the keyboard and button jump to
accept the selection


if you want to see get input stuff in a nice graphical menu press on
keyboard the cheat :
 
"textme"


To see debug stuff as a same thing from above :

"debugme1" and "debugme1" again if you want to close

"debugme2" for moar debug stuff   ---  all is in work in progress :D
